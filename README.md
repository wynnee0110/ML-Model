# Exam Pass/Fail Prediction Model

## Overview
This project focuses on building and training a machine learning model that predicts whether a student will **pass or fail an exam** based on multiple academic, behavioral, and lifestyle-related factors. The primary goal is to understand how different features influence academic performance and to apply core machine learning concepts in a practical, real-world scenario.

The project is designed to be **beginner-friendly while remaining scalable**, allowing for gradual improvements such as feature engineering, model optimization, and deployment.

## Problem Statement
Academic performance is influenced by more than just intelligence or prior grades. Factors such as study habits, attendance, sleep patterns, and consistency play a significant role in exam outcomes.  
This project aims to model these factors and use them to **predict exam results as a binary classification problem** (Pass or Fail).

---

## Features Used
The model uses the following input features:

- Study hours
- Class attendance
- Previous grades
- Sleep hours
- Practice frequency

These features are selected to represent both academic effort and lifestyle balance.

---

## Approach
- Supervised machine learning
- Binary classification (Pass / Fail)
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Model training using historical student data
- Evaluation using standard performance metrics

The workflow includes:
1. Data collection or simulation  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Feature selection and scaling  
4. Model training  
5. Model evaluation  

---

## Model
The project uses a supervised learning algorithm suitable for classification tasks. The model learns patterns from labeled data and predicts whether a student is likely to pass or fail based on the provided features.

Future improvements may include:
- Trying multiple classification algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Feature engineering
- Model persistence and reuse

---

## Results
The trained model outputs a **binary prediction**:
- `Pass`
- `Fail`

Model performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrices.
