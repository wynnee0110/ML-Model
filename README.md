Project Description

This project involves developing and training a machine learning model designed to predict whether a student will pass or fail an exam based on a variety of academic, behavioral, and lifestyle-related factors. The goal is to explore how different inputs—such as study hours, class attendance, previous academic performance, sleep patterns, and practice frequency—contribute to a student’s likelihood of success.

The model follows a supervised learning approach, where historical student data is used to train a classification algorithm capable of identifying patterns associated with successful and unsuccessful exam outcomes. Data preprocessing steps include feature scaling, handling missing values, and exploratory data analysis to better understand correlations between variables.

This project is intended to be beginner-friendly yet scalable, making it suitable for learning core machine learning concepts while allowing room for future improvements such as model optimization, feature engineering, performance evaluation, and deployment. Potential extensions include adding more data sources, experimenting with different algorithms, and deploying the trained model as a web-based prediction service.
